Hi! My name is Lukas Severinghaus and I am a robotics engineering student at Arizona State University on the Polytechnic campus.

I have been interested in robotics and fascinated with making things since a young age. I spend most of my free time building projects to explore things I'm interested in, and as I have entered college, I have used these projects to help build upon the knowledge I gain in my classes. My interests and focus areas are pretty varied:
* I currently intern for [W8less](https://w8less.io) doing software development for customers in the autonomous vehicle and ADAS analysis space and for internal projects around the integration of robotics with UWB based micro-positioning.
* From 2018-2020, I ran a drone based aerial photography company, Northern Arizona Aerial Photography. I'm an FAA Part 107 certificated commercial sUAS (small Unmanned Air System) pilot.
* I design and sew camping gear and EDC (Every Day Carry) items for myself and clients. I have sewn close to a dozen backpacks, sleeping bags, and tarps.
* I am an FCC licensed Extra class Amateur Radio operator, callsign KK6AXQ.

From these interests, I have a gained a diverse skillset that continues to enable my projects, including:
* **Project management.** I have experience organizing projects large and small from inception to completion, both by myself and with others.
* **Communication.** I am a well versed communicator and have experience in composing reports, corresponding in business, and creating technical documents.
* **Full stack (not just software) development.** Most of my projects combine aspects of electrical, mechanical, and software systems to achieve a successful outcome. I have experience with everything from mechanical analysis and design to software architecture and version control. This is the part I enjoy most about my projects, I have the opportunity to explore new fields, tools, and concepts! **A couple of my favorites:**
  * **Software development.** I have experience developing software in C/C++, Python, and Javascript across a variety of contexts for both personal projects and business applications and everywhere from embedded devices to the cloud.
  * **Hardware development.** I have designed, built, and tested several electrical systems including custom circuitry, PCBs, power systems, and wiring harnesses. Most of my projects use KiCAD, and that is my current EDA tool of choice.
  * **Mechanical development.** I have a fair bit of experience in mechanical design and have experience using SolidWorks to design parts for my projects.
  * **Rapid prototyping.** I excel at getting things working together quickly, both to test that the project will work, and to achieve the project results. I have experience in 3D printing and mechanical fabrication and I am currently enrolled in a class on machining prototyping for metal and polymers.
* **Integration.** As any engineer will know, when any two things come together, integration ensues. I have had experience blending diverse hardware and software, and dealing with the inevitable struggles therein, to reach my project goals.

I'm always interested in collaborating with other likeminded people, feel free to reach out and let's see how we can work together!
